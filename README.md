# FashionHouse_Database
This multi-relational database is based on famous global fashion icons' products, categories, and collections.
In this specific database, we have created four distinguished tables. 
1. DESIGNER 2. COLLECTION 3. CATEGORY 4. PRODUCT
The DESIGNER table contains different fashion houses, COLLECTION contains different collections, CATEGORY contains different product categories and PRODUCT contains different products with names, prices, etc.
I have used the SQLite3 library in Python to create this database on Pycharm. It's a simple database which is developed with some help from ChatGPT, but the idea is unique.
Enjoy the code!!
